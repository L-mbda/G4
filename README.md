# G4: A CLI Toy OS written in Python
*This is a toy-OS that I wanted to recreate within the Konnect project that I have done prior.*

## Setup

Please install the necessary packages by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

And then run the application by running ```python platform.py```

Thats it! You can begin setup and other features.
